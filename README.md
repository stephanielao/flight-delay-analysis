Analyzing the departure delay times of flights from 2009-2019

In 1914, the first scheduled passenger airline service took off, departing from St. Petersburg and arriving in Tampa. Since then, flights have become a normal part of life for most people in the U.S. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation's Bureau of Transportation Statistics, there were 797 million passengers that boarded domestic flights just last year. With so many people flying on a daily basis, it is important to know about potential delays for not only passengers but for airlines as well.

We hope to discover what attributes affect how long a flight is delayed upon departure. We initially thought variables such as origin airport, the time of day of the flight, and the distance of the flight may be important variables in determining a departure delay. Moreover, we hope to create a model which predicts the delay time upon departure of any given flight.

We analyzed a dataset on flights from 2009-2019 from Kaggle, gathered from the U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics. The datasets for each year contain information on the flight date, airline carrier, flight number, origin, destination, departure delay time, among other columns.

This analysis was meant to help anyone who is ready to board a flight and is wanting to ensure their flight is on time. Our suggestions include avoiding night flights if possible to ensure your flight has the least possibility of being delayed. Moreover, try to avoid Southwest Airlines, as this carrier has the highest mean and median delay times. Lastly, if you are flying during the summer or before or after Christmas, make preparations ahead of time in the case your flight is delayed.

Avenues for further research include incorporating the year 2020 into our analysis and model. Clearly, with the current state of the pandemic, flights have reduced drastically. From 2019 to 2020 the number of passengers boarding flights decreased by 31.4%. How will this translate regarding delay times?
